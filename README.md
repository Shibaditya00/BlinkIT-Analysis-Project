- **Average Rating** – Customer satisfaction metric across all products

### 📊 Secondary KPIs
- **Total Sales by Fat Content** 
Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
- **Total Sales by Item Type** 
Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
- **Fat Content By Outlet For Total Sales**
Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
- **Total Sales By Outlet Establishment**
Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
